# Wecolme to the Authors project!

This is a joint RA work with [Jordan Holbrook](https://github.com/jordanholbrook) for Professor [Chinhui Juhn](https://uh.edu/~cjuhn/) and [Yona Rubinstein](https://www.lse.ac.uk/management/people/academic-staff/yrubinstein)

In this project we explore data about book authors in the [New York Bestsellers](https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/) and [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov). Motivated by their increasing sucess in publishing books, our goal is to understand female participation in this market.

In this website you will find part of code routines and its outputs, as tables, dataset and plots. Feel free to give us feedbacks through this [link](mailto:angelofgdsantos@gmail.com,jcholbro@central.uh.edu).
